## Installing libtorch C++
There are two steps to installing `libtorch`. First, you need to download a suitable `libtorch` version.
Once the library is downloaded, it's necessary to create a symlink to it in the `dependencies` folder.
Here's how to do it:

### 1. Getting libtorch download link
Get your download link from the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/). Note that opting for the `(cxx11 ABI)` version is paramount.
If you download the `(Pre-cxx11 ABI)` version, things won't work as necessary.

### 2. Downloading libtorch and creating a symlink
Now that you have your url, you can download the library, unzip it and create a symlink in the `dependencies` folder.
```bash
wget <your-url>
unzip <downloaded-zip> -d <your-folder>  # can be `dependencies`
ln -s <your-folder>/libtorch dependencies  # Only necessary if, in the previous step, you did not unzip in `dependencies`
```
Your `dependencies` folder should not look as follows:

</p>
That's it. You should now be able to compile the entire project. Enjoy ðŸ¤—
